## ⚠️ Project Status Update

> "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is step back to move forward stronger." 

**Active Development by NextGenX**

PocketAi is the rebranded and actively developed version of the original PocketAi project, now maintained by NextGenX.

**Why I'm pausing:**
- My internship requires my full attention right now, and I need to prioritize it financially
- Managing both my internship and this project simultaneously has become unsustainable
- The mental load of juggling two complex projects has been taking a toll on my health and well-being
- The project needs more maintainers than I can currently provide alone

**What this means:**
- The repository will remain available, and anyone interested in forking and continuing development is more than welcome to do so
- Once my internship situation stabilizes and I have the bandwidth to give this project the attention it deserves, I plan to resume development
- The Discord community remains open for discussions, collaboration, and support

**A heartfelt thank you:**

I'm genuinely grateful to everyone who has supported this project and stuck around. Your interest and contributions have meant a lot to me. I'm sorry I couldn't deliver the complete product as I had hoped, but I believe this pause is necessary for both the project's future and my own health.

If you're interested in maintaining or contributing to a fork, please feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/mVPwHDhrAP). I'd love to see this project continue in some form.

Thank you for understanding.

## Overview

PocketAi is the first Android application to combine **Chat AI (LLMs)**, **Image Generation (Stable Diffusion)**, **Voice AI (TTS/STT)**, and **Custom Knowledge Injection (RAG)** in a single, privacy-first package. Everything runs entirely on-device with zero internet dependency, or connect to cloud models for maximum flexibility.

### Core Philosophy

Stop choosing between privacy and power. PocketAi gives you both.

**Three Operating Modes:**

- **🔒 Privacy Mode** — Execute GGUF models (Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma), generate images with Stable Diffusion 1.5, use voice AI, and inject custom knowledge—all completely offline. Your data never leaves your phone.
- **⚡ Power Mode** — Access 100+ premium cloud models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini, DALL-E) via OpenRouter for complex tasks requiring maximum capability.
- **🔄 Hybrid Intelligence** — Seamlessly switch between offline and cloud modes mid-conversation while preserving full context and conversation history.

**Q: How big are the model files?**  
A: GGUF models: 0.5GB-8GB depending on model size. SD 1.5: ~2GB. TTS/STT: 50-500MB.

**Q: Can I use my own API keys?**  
A: Yes! BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for OpenRouter. You control costs and usage.

**Q: Is my data really private?**  
A: In offline mode, absolutely nothing leaves your device. Verify in our open-source code.

**Q: Why not just use ChatGPT?**  
A: PocketAi gives you choice, privacy, offline capability, uncensored options, and zero subscriptions.

**Q: Does it support iOS?**  
A: Not currently. Android only due to technical constraints of iOS.

**Q: Can I monetize apps built with this?**  
A: Yes! Apache 2.0 license allows commercial use.
